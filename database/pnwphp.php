Many moons ago, at the tender age of 14, Cal touched his first computer. (We're using the term "computer" loosely here,
it was a TRS-80 Model 1) Since then his life has never been the same. He graduated from TRS-80s to Commodores and
eventually to IBM PC's.

For the past 15 years Cal has worked with PHP and MySQL on Linux, OSX, and Windows. He has built a variety of projects
ranging in size from simple web pages to multi-million dollar web applications. When not banging his head on his monitor,
attempting a blood sacrifice to get a particular piece of code working, he enjoys building and managing development teams
using his widely imitated but never patented management style of "management by wandering around".

These days, when not working with PHP, Cal can be found working on a variety of projects like Nomad PHP. He speaks at
conferences around the world on topics ranging from technical talks to motivational talks for developers. If you happen
to meet him at a conference, don't be afraid to buy him a shot of Bourbon.

Cal is based in Nashville, TN, where he is happily married to wife 1.31,
<a href="http://kathyevans.biz/" target="_blank">the lovely and talented Kathy</a>. Together they have 2 wonderful kids
who were both smart enough not to pursue a job in IT.</p>

As software developers we tend to practice our craft in the way of doctors and lawyers rather than the way of athletes
and musicians, failing to recognize the impact the trade offs and half measures dictated by many projects have on our
growth as craftspeople. Code katas - deliberate practice, free of the pressures of "getting things done" - are an
excellent way to strengthen our mental "muscle memory" and grow our craft. In this three hour workshop, we will examine
the case for regular, deliberate practice and engage in guided, collaborative, hands-on learning designed to give you
the skills to incorporate code katas and deliberate practice into your training regimen.

my career in a positive manner; it has been a JATO strapped to my career. I'm just a programmer, not even a great one.

Every PHP developer needs to know about cloud computing! With roots in simple yet powerful foundational services for
compute and storage, the cloud has grown to become one of the most dynamic and interesting technologies of our day.
Traditionally, infrastructure was that noisy, boring stuff in the dark room that someone else took care of for you.
With the cloud, infrastructure is front and center, and much easier to use. With a couple of clicks (or API calls) you
can spin up the resources you need, configure them in minutes, and use them to build, run, and scale your application.

This talk is designed to give you a whirlwind tour of the cloud that is simultaneously big-picture and detailed. We'll
make four scenic steps (all backed by demos and sample code) along the way. First, we'll look at the cloud at a better
host for your existing PHP apps, spinning up an EC2 server and getting a database-powered app running. Then we'll make
it a bit more sophisticated, with some automated scaling, load balancing, and a more sophisticated database solution.
From there we will look a higher-level tools like Elastic Beanstalk and CloudFormation that will add structure and
automation to your development, testing, and hosting discipline. Finally, we'll hang out with the native cloud APIs,
and look at how to create applications that make use of specific cloud services such as DynamoDB.

"Big ships turn slowly", the saying goes. That's true nautically and in software. Software grows over time, and the
bigger it gets the harder it is to make significant changes. When those changes are not just technical but cultural the
task becomes even harder.

But harder doesn't have to mean impossible. If Drupal can modernize itself from a PHP 4 procedural application to a PHP
5.5+ object-oriented platform, you can do the same with your project. It just requires being pragmatic.

No matter how old your code base, there is still hope! Let's see what it takes to modernize a legacy code base, and how
to build toward the system you want to have. Refactoring legacy code is just like eating an elePHPant... you do it one
bite at a time.

We'll go over some of the tools and strategies for getting your PHP (and other) applications easily and automatically
continuously deployed. We'll cover how to automate testing, integrating changes, deploying, failover, and rolling back.

For 20 years, PHP has emerged as a quickly, and sometimes
haphazardly evolving language and runtime responding to the needs of
the nascent "world wide web" which was growing up alongside it. Other
implementations have appeared and fallen away over time, but one has
made a real lasting impact, not just on the ecosystem, but on the
language and reference implementation themselves. I'll take you on a
journey through the history of "the other PHPs", what makes
reimplementing the double-claw so hard, how competition is good, and
why the next five years are poised to be some of PHP's best.

Enter the Joomla! Framework.

By extracting the API that has powered the Joomla! CMS since its birth into standalone and modular packages, we enable developers to use an API they are already familiar with to create standalone applications specific to client needs. This also enables developers to more easily consume code written for and shared with the full PHP community. Lastly, we are now able to offer the core APIs powering Joomla for use in Drupal or Laravel based projects.

We’ll take a look at how lowering the barriers to using and developing with Joomla’s own code base enables the Joomla! code base to be integrated with other PHP projects and how these integrations lay the framework for a stronger and more flexible next generation CMS.',

functionality of the same capabilities within AWS (VPC, Route 53, EBS, ELB, EC2, CloudWatch, etc.).

No matter what level of development we are at in our careers we all face a daily battle to write good code for ourselves
 and others, deliver finished applications fast to satisfy business, and ensure everything is properly tested to prevent
 end-user fails. In this session we will discuss what clean application development is, and how it can help us win those
 battles. The talk will provide practical and usable examples to take with you, integrate into your workflow, and
 continue to grow into good habits. (Topics: Version control, refactoring, coding standards, frameworks, architecture,
 automation, time management, and more.)

Imagine the day where you get an email from your CEO: “Our site has
been hacked! Millions of user records have been leaked! And we’re
being sued!”… Unfortunately, that situation appears to be quite common
place in the modern world. In the past year alone LinkedIn, Sony,
Zappos, Twitter, Apple, Yahoo and LastFM (and a lot more) have
compromised, leaking over 100 million user records. How has this
become common place? Developers traditionally haven’t focused on
security (that’s someone else’s problem, right?)… Wrong! Security is
everyone’s job!

Come and learn more about how to identify and fix security issues! In
this workshop, we’ll cover the most dangerous and prevalent security
vulnerabilities in PHP applications today. We’ll look at how those
vulnerabilities work under the hood, and how to prevent them. Then,
we’ll spend time reviewing actual code with actual vulnerabilities.
Once we’ve identified a potential vulnerability, you will actually
execute an attack against it! By the end of the workshop, you should
be able to identify insecure code and fix it!

Who is the target audience of this workshop?
<ul>
<li>Any developer who has preformed code-review before</li>
<li>Any developer who wants to understand security better</li>
</ul>

How experienced do I need to be?
<ul>
<li>If you understand how to read code, you have enough experience to attend this workshop!</li>
</ul>

Tutorial requirements:
<ul>
<li>A laptop</li>
</ul>

A cursory understanding of the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project">OWASP Top 10</a>

More audio and video is recorded every day than was recorded over the entire 20th century, and that rate is
accelerating.  Unfortunately, most recorded media is wasted because it is "invisible" to our current computer systems
without a lot of effort in organization and tagging. Clarify is a cloud-based, REST API that processes your audio and
video for data like words spoken, keywords, and topics. The API also allows you to assign custom or arbitrary metadata
such as title, description, tags, subject, producer, or publish date to any media. The data is then organized by a
powerful search engine and exposed through search queries, filters, and reports.  Human-powered transcription services
are available on-demand through the API, too.
